```

## 🚀 Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install nicegui fastapi uvicorn
```

2. Run the application locally:
```bash
python main.py
```

3. Open browser at: `http://localhost:8080`

## 🌐 Deployment

### Vercel Deployment

This app is configured for Vercel deployment using FastAPI integration:

1. **Install Vercel CLI** (if not already installed):
```bash
npm i -g vercel
```

2. **Deploy to Vercel**:
```bash
vercel
```

3. **Configuration**:
   - The `pyproject.toml` is configured with `entrypoint = "main:app"` for Vercel
   - The app uses `ui.run_with(app)` to integrate NiceGUI with FastAPI
   - Database initialization happens automatically on startup

4. **Environment Variables** (optional):
   - Set `STORAGE_SECRET` for persistent user storage if needed
   - Set `DB_PATH` to customize database location (defaults to `/tmp/puzzles.db` on Vercel)

**Note**: Vercel serverless functions use `/tmp` for writable storage. The SQLite database will be regenerated on each cold start. For production with persistent storage, consider using an external database (PostgreSQL, Redis) instead of SQLite.

### Docker Deployment

Alternatively, use Docker for deployment:

```bash
docker build -t cryptarithm .
docker run -p 8080:8080 cryptarithm
```

## 📦 Module Descriptions

### `main.py`
- Application entry point
- Initializes database and quiz state
- Sets up navigation between Solver and Quiz pages
- Auto-generates initial puzzles on first run

### `solver.py`
- Core cryptarithmetic solving algorithm
- Uses permutations to find valid digit assignments
- Validates leading zeros and arithmetic operations
- Returns complete solution with mapping and verification

### `database.py`
- SQLite database management
- Stores puzzles with difficulty levels
- Batch operations for performance
- WAL mode for concurrent access
- Export to JSON functionality

### `generator.py`
- Generates cryptarithmetic puzzles
- Uses 3 unique letters (A-Z)
- 20+ puzzle patterns
- Ensures at least 2 multi-character words
- Batch generation for efficiency

### `quiz_state.py`
- Manages quiz state (score, attempts, progress)
- Tracks 10-question limit
- Handles hint usage
- Provides quiz completion detection

### `ui_solver.py`
- Solver page interface
- Input field with examples
- Real-time solving
- Visual solution display with mappings

### `ui_quiz.py`

## 🎮 Features

### Solver Mode
- Solve any cryptarithmetic puzzle
- Support for addition and subtraction
- Example puzzles included
- Visual solution display

### Quiz Mode
- 10 random questions per quiz
- 3 unique letters per puzzle
- Scoring system:
  - +10 points for correct answer
  - +5 bonus for no hints used
- Hint system (reveals one letter)
- Performance evaluation
- Progress tracking

### Database
- 500+ generated puzzles
- Fast random selection
- Difficulty levels (Easy/Medium/Hard)
- Export to JSON

## 🔧 Configuration

### Puzzle Generation Rules
- Minimum 2 words with 2+ characters
- 3 unique letters (A-Z)
- No pure single-letter puzzles (e.g., A + B = C)
- Valid patterns: AA + BB = CC, KK + Z = SS, etc.

### Quiz Settings
- Questions per quiz: 10 (configurable in `quiz_state.py`)
- Points per correct answer: 10
- No-hint bonus: 5
- Letter count: 3

## 🐛 Bug Fixes Applied

1. ✅ Fixed hint button functionality
2. ✅ Changed from ABC-only to full A-Z alphabet
3. ✅ Accepts any mathematically valid solution
4. ✅ Prevents single-letter arbitrary puzzles
5. ✅ Fixed multiple scoring on same question
6. ✅ Fixed database locking issues

## 📝 Example Puzzles

### Easy
- AA + BB = CC
- AB + BA = CC
- KK + Z = SS

### Medium
- ABC + ABC = BCA
- AAB + BAA = BBA

### Hard
- ABC + ABC = ABCC
- AAA + BBB = CCC

## 🎯 Usage Tips

1. Start with Solver mode to understand the puzzles
2. Try example puzzles first
3. Use hints sparingly in Quiz mode for bonus points
4. Generate more puzzles if needed
5. Export puzzles to JSON for backup

## 🔐 Technical Details

- **Framework**: NiceGUI (Python web framework)
- **Database**: SQLite with WAL mode
- **Algorithm**: Brute-force permutation search
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS classes
- **Storage**: Persistent SQLite database

## 📊 Performance

- Puzzle generation: ~500 puzzles in seconds
- Solving speed: Near-instant for 3-letter puzzles
- Database queries: Optimized with batch operations
- No backend API required - all runs locally
